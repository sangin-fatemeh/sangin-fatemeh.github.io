Abstract. Segmentation of independently moving objects is an important stage in scene comprehension tasks like tracking and recognition. Frame-based cameras employed for dynamic scenes suffer from motion blur and exposure artifacts due to the sampling principle. In contrast, event-based cameras sample visual information based on scene dynamics and have the advantages of microsecond temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and more. Inspired by the complimentary of frame-based cameras and event-based cameras, we propose a cross-domain motion segmentation method, named FusionSeg, for fusing visual signals from frames and events to improve motion segmentation performance. To solve motion segmentation problem on the multi-objects scenario, we use the identification mechanism to embed multiple objects into the same feature space. In addition, to solve the feature matching and propagation problem, we design a long and short-term temporal-spatial attention. Our FusionSeg is evaluated on public datasets and outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 4.7% in terms of detection rate. Experiments also demonstrate our methodâ€™s robustness in situations with varying motion patterns and numbers of moving objects.
