## Proving Poincare in $$N\geq 6$$

Theorem (h-cobordism theorem): Let $M$ be a simply connected smooth compact $N$ h-cobordism between a pair $(B_{0}, B_{1})$ that are $N-1$ manifolds. In $N\geq 6$, there exists a diffeomorphism between the product $B_{0}\times [0, 1]$ and $M$. 

In this case, our attention is in the $N\geq 6$ case, which for the moment we will consider as a version of the Poincare conjecture. In terms of homotopy to the $N-$Sphere, the Poincare conjecture in our setting can be rewritten. How does one work this out? This is a beautiful result by Smale, which is an outline of the Poincare conjecture itself in this setting. The statement, with a proof that can be written rather naively is as follows:

Poincare conjecture in $N\geq 6$: For a smooth manifold with homotopy-equivalence to the $N-$Sphere, there exists a homeomorphism to the $N-$Sphere. 

Proof: Well the proof is slightly non-trivial to write it out here. Check the notes for a quick look at this. 


# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to my page!
Here, I am going to tell the stories about the fantastic world of publications, especially those which were born in the world of machine learning and computer vision.

## Please accompany me!
As I am going on my journy, I would like to invite you to accompany me. What I mean with this is that, I'd like to share the things I learn with you. E.g, I'd like to share what a paper that I recently read is all about. Please stay tuned and let's collaborate. 
See you later guys!
